# WEB-project

A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project created as part of a university assignment. 
This project serves as an example of my front-end development skills, showcasing my ability to create responsive designs and implement interactive elements.

Clone the repository and open index.html in any modern web browser to explore the project.
Feel free to modify the code to better understand its functionality.
